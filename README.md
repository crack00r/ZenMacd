## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".

## Quick-start

### 1. Requirements: Ubuntu Xenial

### 2. Install zenbot 4:

Run in your console,

```
git clone https://github.com/TheRoboKitten/zenmacd.git
```

Then run:
```
sudo sh setup.sh
```

Make sure to input your poloniex API KEY and HASH into conf-example.js


Follow the on-screen instructions.


To update your coin pairs navigate to:
```
cd extensions/exchanges/poloniex
```
Then do:
```
sudo chmod 777 update-products.sh
sudo ./update-products.sh
```

### Note:
If you set your buy% to anything other than 100% you will get more trade fees!!
This stuff takes a close eye, it can work fine for an hour alone maybe tops, but you absolutely want to check for order activity. IE. If an order is on hold in poloniex, then make sure that order is being adjusted through the shell window.



### Running:

To run do:

```
sudo python3 macdtrader.py
```
It will be filling the database on the first rounds, and updates every round and each coin... Can be slow, but can be very profitable from the looks of it.
